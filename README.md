# About the Game
The website is based on the 1970's electronic game Simon which it self is based on the school yard game. The electronic version was created
by Ralph Baer and Howard Morrison, which creates a series of lights and sounds that the player must reproduce in order to progress to 
incremently more difficult sequences. For more information on the origin and history of the game click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game))
