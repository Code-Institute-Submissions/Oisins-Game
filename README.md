# Simon Game

Interactive Frontend Development Project - Code Institute

### Disclaimer This game is not for commercial use and is soley for educational use as a code institute project.

# Demo

This project is hosted on Github pages and the live version can be found [here](https://davidcaffrey.github.io/Oisins-Game/).

# About the Game
The website is based on the 1970's electronic game Simon which it self is based on the school yard game. The electronic version was created
by Ralph Baer and Howard Morrison, which creates a series of lights and sounds that the player must reproduce in order to progress to 
incremently more difficult sequences. For more information on the origin and history of the game click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)).

# UX 

The game was designed to be a retro feel single player experience that would try to recreate the look and feel of the 1970's. Whilst the 
game works on all platforms, given the amount of screen real estate that is taken up, it works better on desktop. Although the same is 
simple in concept a modal was added to provide instructions and to save valuable screen space.
The player presses the play button to start the game, the game then plays a short sequence of two which the player has then to reproduce.
This eases the player gently into the game and progresses by one each round, all the time adjusting the score, lives and level counter to 
give feedback to the player as to how they are progressing. The sound effects added to the UX by giving the player audio cues as to how they are doing, a negative sound indicating they had failed, a positive sound of encouragement when they remembered correctly and then finally when they had lost all of their three lives a very dramatic finale sound along with a message on screen letting them know.

Overall these elements together provide an interactive experience that meets the user requirements.

# Wireframing 

No wireframe was needed for such a design as the design reflected the actual electonic game.

# Features for future implementation

- Hi score system that will take the players initials ie DPC to recreate the arcade experience (maybe via another modal?)
- Two player mode 
- Allow the user to choose Expert level whereby they can play by sound only and no animations of buttons

# Testing 

The testing phase of the project consisted of incremental manual unit testing firstly on the live preview then on the hosted Github pages. The testing revealed that although the game works fine on the smaller screens it is ultimately a better user experience on larger
screens. This process of implementing and testing helped to keep the project moving forward but uncertainty over the quality of code.
NOTE: one console log was deliberately left in the code so that the assessor would be able to see the game selections and use them for their own validation process.
Overall the game meets the requirements of being highly interactive, fun, and challenging.

# Issues 
As can be seen through the commit history the code was refactored to reduce the repetion of code such as event-listeners. The code readability could be improved along with the logic flow, which are things that will be improved on over time and with hindsight.
Whilst no wireframe was required for the UI, techniques could have been employed such as pseudocode, in the early stages, to improve the
code. Employing these early and sticking to them would have made the process easier and therefore would have made it possible to implement those features not yet included.

# Personal Takeaway

Overall the project has been a great lesson in how to put together an interactive web app. Whilst it is fully functioning the code can
be improved upon by undertaking a more systematic approach to both the program flow and structure and these shortcomings will be rectified in future projects and possibly a refactor of this projects code from the ground up.

# Deployment

The project was deployed through the Github pages using the master branch. Commits to the master branch updated the project straight 
away, thus allowing the project to be tested on the preview and the live site.The live site is hosted [here](https://davidcaffrey.github.io/Oisins-Game/) and the site can be downloaded locally from [here](https://github.com/DavidCaffrey/Oisins-Game) using Git clone or downloading the zip.
