# About the Game
The website is based on the 1970's electronic game Simon which it self is based on the school yard game. The electronic version was created
by Ralph Baer and Howard Morrison, which creates a series of lights and sounds that the player must reproduce in order to progress to 
incremently more difficult sequences. For more information on the origin and history of the game click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)).

# UX 

The game was designed to be a retro feel single player experience that would try to recreate the look and feel of the 1970's. Whilst the 
game works on all platforms, given the amount of screen real estate that is taken up, it works better on desktop. Although the same is 
simple in concept a modal was added to provide instructions and to save valuable screen space.
The player presses the play button to start the game, the game then plays a short sequence of two which the player has then to reproduce.
This eases the player gently into the game and progresses by one each round, all the time adjusting the score, lives and level counter to 
give feedback to the player as to how they are progressing. The sound effects added to the UX by giving the player audio cues as to how they are doing, a negative sound indicating they had failed, a positive sound of encouragement when they remembered correctly and then finally when they had lost all of their three lives a very dramatic finale sound along with a message on screen letting them know.

Overall these elements together provide an interactive experience that meets the user requirements.
